## Problem Definition

In this dataset sourced from NYC Open Data portal, we need to design and implement a data engineering solution that can integrate, transform, and load this data into a centralized data warehouse, enabling the data analysts and scientists to easily access and analyze it. The solution must be scalable, resilient, and secure, able to handle increasing data volumes and diverse data types while ensuring data integrity and compliance with data protection regulations. The ultimate goal of this data engineering solution is to enable our organization to make data-driven decisions, improve customer engagement, and drive business growth.

## Learning

This project has a strong emphasis on applied learning. I got to analyze restaurants inspections happening in NYC, using information from the NYC Open Data portal to build a data engineering pipeline involving data extraction, data cleansing, transformation, exploratory analysis, data visualization, and data flow orchestration of event data on the cloud.

## Data Source

**DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results** - The dataset contains every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an active status. This dataset and the information on the Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source. The Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website is here:
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page

The dataset for this project is acquired from NYC Open Data Portal:
